Making the game Tictactoe we used Github for source control.Travis and Heroku for the intergration service and
dhe game was made with test driven development. The game is played on a web browser.


How the game is played:

The game is on a 3x3 grid player 1 mark one cell with an X with a computer mouse and then it is player 2's turn put one mark on 
a cell with an O. When either player has gotten three marks in a row(Up,Down or sideways) he wins the game. If all 
cells are full and no one has three in a row then there is a tie.
